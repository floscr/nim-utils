#+TITLE: Readme

A bunch of simple tools to use with my [[https://nixos.org/][nixos]] setup written in [[https://nim-lang.org/][Nim]].

* Usage

Only usable with nix flakes currently, have a look at this [[https://github.com/floscr/dotfiles/commit/bdab27c5a3b48a5c05cb26cd48bc2528143ba58c][commit]] on how I'm using them in my system.
Or build with the commands below and use the bins directly.

Building directly with nim might not work, as I might be passing special flags etc with nix.

* Scripts

** get_url_title

Fetch the title tag of a passed url

*** Build

#+begin_src
nix build .#get_url_title
#+end_src

*** Usage

#+begin_src sh
get_url_title "https://nim-lang.org/"
# Nim Programming Language
#+end_src
